Learning how to use the Instagram API.

Have an idea for an app to be used by travelers where you could enter a location you're traveling to and it would show you, based on geotagged Instagram posts, what other people in your network were recently or currently traveling in the same place.

Not sure if this is possible with Instagram API, or if this has already been done, but I want to learn how to use the API either way.
